; Exercise 1.8: Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y
; is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
; given by the value
; \frac{x / y^2 + 2 y}{3}.
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
; square-root procedure.
