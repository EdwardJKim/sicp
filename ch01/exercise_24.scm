; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use
; fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in
; that exercise. Since the Fermat test has Î˜(logn) growth, how would you expect
; the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to
; test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any
; discrepancy you find?
